<h3> What are crystals? </h3>
  <p>Crystals are nothing more than an established batch of molecules or atoms. Crystals come in many different shapes and sizes, and each one has different characteristics. What they are made of determines how it will form. Some crystals can be made from salt--these make cubed-shaped crystals. Some are derived from other elements and form completely different shapes. Some examples of these are diamonds or rubies. There are some elements that can create more than one shape. When the element carbon is in the form of a diamond, it can be used to cut gemstones, but we use it every day in other forms in a variety of things. The biggest form in which we use it is to supply electricity to our homes and businesses. </p>
<h3>How are crystals created?</h3>
  <p>In each case, it’s a three-step process. It begins with nucleation, in which a few molecules or atoms approach each other in a suitable orientation to form a stable submicroscopic aggregate. The second stage is growth, which is an orderly addition of further molecules or atoms to the surface of the crystal in a regular manner. And the final step – termination – stops the growth process.
It’s interesting to estimate how rapidly molecules should arrange themselves at the surface of a growing crystal. Even if a crystal is growing at a rate of one-tenth of an inch per day, about 100 layers of molecules must be laid down per second at the crystal surface. <br> In terms of size, there is no limit to how large a crystal one may grow. We are only limited by our patience and material supply. The largest crystal found in nature is a beryl from Madagascar. It measures 59 feet long, 19 feet across and weighs 360 tons.
Crystals that are found in nature are called minerals. But there are also crystals that are not found in nature and are made by scientists — for example, crystals of proteins or viruses. <br> Here is a video about how crystals are created. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PgSRAsgrKmg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
